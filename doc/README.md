### Usage
Two Matrix rooms are required to use this bot.

#### "Reporting" room
This room is open to everyone. Here people can share news any time. Editors can mark messages, but also images and videos with emoji reactions here. For example...
- ‚≠ï: Approve a message (to include it in the rendered markdown)
- üì∑Ô∏è: Add image. The image will then be automatically added to the corresponding news message, and inserted in the rendered markdown. 
- üõ∞Ô∏è: Add message to the third-party section

Those emojis are just an example, you can configure them as you want in the `config.toml` file. 

#### "Admin" room
In this closed room administrative commands can be executed.

### Configuration
In order to use the bot, two configuration files are required. The `config.toml` configuration file contains the bot settings (e.g. username/password, room ids, ...) and the definitions for the sections and projects. The second configuration file `template.md` serves as a template for the actual summary.

For both configuration files, examples are available that can be used as templates (see `example_config` folder). 

### Deployment
The bot is available as [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/haeckerfelix/hebbot).
You can find an example `docker-compose.yml` inside the `example_config` folder.
